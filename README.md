This backend consist of a SQL connector from a PHP which return a JSON file which consist of the token.
The backend is only a proof of concept and by any means it should not be use for producition. 
The current architecture is to have the Securify App to talk to the server and store all the necessary credential. 
LAMP stack MAMP were used primarily used in order to allow simple HTTP request to the domain. 
The php script allows the user to register; edit their credential. The application uses the success field to check if the api has been handled
